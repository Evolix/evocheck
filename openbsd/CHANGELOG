### Added

* Add check_advskew: convention for CARP interfaces. CARP in master state must have advskew parameter between 1 and 50, CARP in backup state must have advskew parameter between 100 and 150, preventing a configuration error with the same value for master and backup

* Fix check_noatime: do not take into account commented entry in fstab

## [6.7.7] - 2020-10-22
